            <h1>==========================</h1>
            <p>High-quality health care helps prevent diseases and improve quality of life. Healthy People 2030 focuses on improving health care quality and making sure all people get the health care services they need.

                Helping health care providers communicate more effectively can help improve health and well-being. Strategies to make sure health care providers are aware of treatment guidelines and recommended services are also key to improving health.
                
                Some people don’t get the health care services they need because they don’t have health insurance or live too far away from providers who offer them. Interventions to increase access to health care services — like lowering costs, improving insurance coverage, and increasing use of telehealth — can help more people get the care they need.</p>

            <h1>==========================</h1>
            <p>
                The idea of the government ensuring that people have access to health care began long before Medicare. While local governments experimented with health care for centuries, the first national health insurance program came from Germany's Otto von Bismarck in the 1880s</p>
